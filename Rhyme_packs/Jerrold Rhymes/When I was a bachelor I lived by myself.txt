When I was a bachelor, I lived by myself,
And all the bread and cheese I got, I put upon a shelf,
The rats and the mice did trouble so my life,
That I went up to London, to get myself a wife.
The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow,
I could not get my wife home without a wheelbarrow;
The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall,
I could not get her home without a wheelbarrow;
