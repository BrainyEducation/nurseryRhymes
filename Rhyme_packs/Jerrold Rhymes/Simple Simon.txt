Simple Simon Met a pie-man,
Going to the fair;
Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
"Let me taste your ware."

Says the pie-man to Simple Simon,
"First give me a penny."
Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
"I have not got any."

He went to catch a little bird,
And thought he could not fail,
Because he had a little salt
To put upon his tail.

He went to ride a spotted cow,
That had a little calf,
She threw him down upon the ground,
Which made the people laugh.

Then Simple Simon went out hunting,
Tried to catch a bear,
He rode a goat about the street,
But could not find one there.
He tried to eat some honey,
Out of the pepper pot,
He bit his tongue until he cried,
The pepper was too hot.

Simple Simon went out fishing,
Tried to catch a whale,
But all the water that he found
Was in his mother's pail.
