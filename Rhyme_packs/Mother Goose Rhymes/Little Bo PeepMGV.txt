Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep,
And can't tell where to find them.
Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
Wagging their tails behind them.
Little Bo Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamed she heard them bleating,
But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
They were lost in some hayfield eating.
Then up she took her little crook,
Determined for to find them.
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
For they'd left their tails behind them.
It happened one day, as Bo Peep did stray,
Into a meadow close by;
There she did spy their tails side by side,
Hung on a tree to dry.
