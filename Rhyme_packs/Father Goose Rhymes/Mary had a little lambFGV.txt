Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow,
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
It followed her to school one day,
Which was against the rule.
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.
And so the teacher put it out,
But still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about
Till Mary did appear.
"What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager children cry.
“Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
The teacher did reply.
