When good King Arthur ruled his land
He was a goodly king;
He stole three sacks of barley meal
To make a bag-pudding.
A bag-pudding the king did make,
And stuffed it well with plums,
And in it put great lumps of fat
As big as my two thumbs.
The king and queen ate less than half,
Not much more, though they tried,
And what they could not eat that night
The queen next morning fried.
