"Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young,
So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung,
Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird,
So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard.

"O, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine,
You shall feed on cherry pie and drink new apple wine,
I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay,
So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine let us decide today."

Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind:
"Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I'll take your offer kind;
Cherry pie is very nice and so is apple wine,
But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine."
