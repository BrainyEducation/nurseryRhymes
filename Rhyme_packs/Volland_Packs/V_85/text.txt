Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree,
Up went the Kitty-Cat, and down went he,
Down came Kitty-Cat, away Robin ran;
Says little Robin Redbreast: "Catch me if you can!"

Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a spade,
Kitty-Cat jumped after him, and then he was afraid.
Little Robin chirped and sang, and what did Kitty say?
Kitty-Cat said: "Meow, meow, meow," and Robin flew away.
