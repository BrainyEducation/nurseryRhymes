There was an old woman got tossed in a blanket
Seventeen times as high as the moon;
But where she was going no person could tell,
For under her arm she carried a broom.

"Old woman, old woman, old woman," said I,
"Where in the world are you flying so high?"
"To sweep the cobwebs from the sky,
And I'll be with you by and by."
