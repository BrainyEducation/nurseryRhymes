There was an old woman tossed up in a basket
Seventeen times as high as the moon;
Where she was going I couldn't but ask it,
For in her hand she carried a broom.

"Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I,
"Where arre you going to up so high?"
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky!"
"May I go with thee?"
"Aye, by-and-by."
