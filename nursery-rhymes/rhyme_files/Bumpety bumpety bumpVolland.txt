A farmer went trotting upon his gray mare,
Bumpety, bumpety, bump,
With his daughter behind him, so rosy and fair,
Lumpety, lumpety, lump.

A blackbird cried "Croak," and they all tumbled down,
Bumpety, bumpety, bump;
The mare broke her knees and the farmer his crown,
Lumpety, lumpety, lump.

The mischievous blackbird flew laughing away,
Bumpety, bumpety, bump,
And promised to do just the same the same next day!
Lumpety, lumpety, lump.
