Simple Simon Met a pie-man,
Going to the fair;
Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
"Let me taste your ware."

Says the pie-man to Simple Simon,
"First give me a penny."
Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
"I have not got any."

He went to catch a little bird,
And thought he could not fail,
Because he had a little salt
To put upon his tail.
